      <!--What is Hacked-->
      <h3>What is HACKED?</h3>
      <p>HACKED is a free-to-attend, intense weekend of learning, sharing and building cool stuff. Whether you are an
      expert or novice, developer or designer, join us for what we guarantee will be a memorable experience.</p>

      <p>Hacking is all about playing with technology and using it in new and creative ways. We're not talking about building
      battled-hardened products - many of the more memorable hacks from similar events have been pulled off thanks to
      crossed-fingers and the generous use of sticky tape!</p>

      <p>If you have ever been to a hack day before, you'll know the fun of making new things quickly, experimenting and
      collaborating with people from all sorts of backgrounds and levels of experience.</p>

      <p>We will be inviting a number of companies to HACKED and they are going to  make their APIs available.
      There will be plenty of hands-on sessions and one-to-one help, so don't be scared about getting involved!</p>

      <!--Tell Me MOAR!-->
      <h3>Can you tell me any more?</h3>
      <p>The exact schedule and content is still being finalised, but we'll have more to tell you by late spring.</p>

      <!-- Tickets-->
      <h3>When are tickets being released?</h3>
      <p>We're not quite ready to release tickets yet, but don't worry, they will be available early enough for you to make travel arrangements.
      <a href="register.html">Register your interest</a> to get details as soon as we have them!</p>

      <p>If you are planning to come from far away (another country, planet or dimension!)
      <!-- O2 Roof In Use (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VzrtdNecBI) illegally parked Spaceships will be towed-->
      drop an email to <a href="mailto:help@hacked.io">help@hacked.io</a> and we will do our best to help.</p>

      <!--For Mr Duck and his Soldering Iron-->
      <h3>What about hardware hacks?</h3>
      <p>We want HACKED to be more than just about code, so we're currently sorting out the
      practical aspects of allowing physical hacks, such as ensuring we don't blow the venue's power!</p>

      <!--Where-->
      <h3>Where and when is HACKED?</h3>
      <p>We will be taking over <a href="http://www.theo2.co.uk/indigo2/index.html">IndigO2</a>, inside
      <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/AAw73">The O2</a> in London on July 20th and 21st 2013.</p>

      <!--Overnight-->
      <h3>Can I stay overnight?</h3>
      <p>Yes, you are welcome to bring your sleeping bag! Alternatively, there are plenty of hotels and guest houses nearby.</p>

      <!--Sponsorship-->
      <h3>Can my company sponsor HACKED?</h3>
      <p>Yes! Please see our sponsorship page for further information or email <a href="mailto:sponsor@hacked.io">sponsor@hacked.io</a></p>

      <!--Become a HackMaker-->
      <h3>Can I volunteer or help out?</h3>
      <p>Hold your horses! <a href="register.html">Register your interest</a> and we will let you know when we are looking for our 2013 "HackMakers"</p>

      <!--You lost something or you think we did-->
      <h3>Can I ask another question?</h3>
      <p>We're always happy to answer any questions you have. Drop us an email on <a href="mailto:help@hacked.io">help@hacked.io</a>.</p>
